# Hey Folks ðŸ‘‹
I am a **Chemical Engineering PhD candidate** at LSU in [Romagnoli Group](https://pse.che.lsu.edu/)  utilizing the benefits of physics & machine learning to enhance the design of electrochemical systems.

                             - Mahatma Gandhi

- ðŸŒ± Developing data-driven and physics-based models for materials (small molecules like solvent, ions; big molecules like surfactant, polymers) and processes (like electrodialysis, electrodeionization, capacitive deionization).
- Post PhD, I hope to join an R&D position where I can focus on developing sustainable materials and technologies.
